        <p>
          The escalating controversy over President Trump’s phone conversation with Ukraine’s president has ignited a battle on Capitol
          Hill over Democrats’ demands for a copy of the whistleblower complaint against Trump, as some liberal lawmakers threatened
          subpoenas while Republicans called for restraint while they gather facts.

          “The Senate Republican ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. “This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.”
          The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

          In a statement Monday, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley called for lawmakers not to rush to judgment.

          In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week.
